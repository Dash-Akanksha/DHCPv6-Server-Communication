# DHCPv6-Server-Communication
Configuration of a stateful DHCPv6 server on a dedicated server using Cisco Packet Tracer to dynamically assign IPv6 addresses in a LAN.
Project 2: Configure the Stateful DHCPv6 Server on a Dedicated Server
Tool: Cisco Packet Tracer
Timeline: July 2025
Status: âœ… Completed

ðŸ“„ Overview
Configured a stateful DHCPv6 server to dynamically assign IPv6 addresses to client devices in a simulated LAN environment. This project involved working with Router Advertisements, DHCPv6 relay settings, and address assignment for efficient IPv6 communication.

ðŸ”§ Features
Set up a dedicated DHCPv6 server for IPv6 address management

Enabled Router Advertisement (RA) to support DHCPv6 stateful mode

Successfully assigned unique IPv6 addresses to clients dynamically

Ensured full IPv6 communication within the LAN environment

ðŸ“ˆ Learnings
In-depth understanding of DHCPv6 (Stateful mode) and how it differs from SLAAC

Configuration of IPv6 networking in simulated environments

Troubleshooting IPv6 address assignment issues

Real-world relevance in enterprise-level IPv6 deployment
